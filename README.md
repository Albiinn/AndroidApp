# Bookism App
## Bookism is made by Arber Hyseni and Albin Bajrami, under the mentoring of Prof. Ass. Arbnor Halili
An Android App made by two students, that brings together book fanatics to share about their favorite books. How our app works is pretty simple and straightforward. First the user is greeted by a beautiful welcome screen where the user has the possibility to register and login, the registration and login are made available by the realtime database provided by Firebase. After that the user has the possibility to create posts about his favorite books, then he has a little playground section made by us that demonstrate tasks with threads, camera activities etc.

This app is developed using Android Studio and is made for educational purposes only.
